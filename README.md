# Overheat-detector
 Issues caused by Overheating:
 Damage to circuits
 Performance Issues
 Fire or Explosion

Objectives:
 To make efficient overheat detector using Arduino / Microcontroller, sensors and alarm system.
 To alarm the user about the overheated system, so that some actions can be taken.
 It can also be used in detecting the room temperature and the alarm will be activated if the temperature is higher than required.

Working:
 The project utilizes a temperature sensor connected to the targeted machine.
 Arduino code is programmed to trigger a buzzer alarm when the temperature surpasses a specified threshold value.
 When the temperature remains within the threshold, the buzzer remains silent, and the  LED  does not illuminate.
 Upon exceeding the threshold, the buzzer activates, and the red LED turns on.
